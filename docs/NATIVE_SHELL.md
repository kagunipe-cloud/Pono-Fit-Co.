# Native shell (iOS & Android) — branch workflow & Capacitor

This repo may add a **native wrapper** (e.g. Capacitor) for App Store / Play distribution and Kisi Tap-to-Unlock. The **PWA and production site** stay the primary path; the shell branch carries **extra** iOS/Android project files on top of the same app.

## Branches

| Branch        | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `main`        | Source of truth for **shared** work: API, UI, fixes, anything that should ship for **all** users (browser + future app). |
| `native-shell`| `main` **plus** native-only additions (Xcode project, Capacitor config, Kisi SDK integration, etc.). |

Each branch still contains the **full codebase**; we organize **which commits** land where, not separate “partial” repos.

Merge `main` → `native-shell` often (while on `native-shell`): `git fetch origin` then `git merge main`.

## Day-to-day

1. **Shared change** (should go to production for everyone): commit on **`main`**, push `main`.
2. **Update the app branch** so it doesn’t fall behind:
   ```bash
   git switch native-shell
   git merge main
   ```
3. **Native-only change**: on **`native-shell`**, commit and push `native-shell`.

## What was added (Capacitor)

- **`capacitor.config.ts`** — app id `co.ponofit.app`, display name **Pono Fit**, **`webDir`: `www`**
- **`www/index.html`** — tiny fallback if remote URL is missing (normally the WebView loads your **deployed** site)
- **`ios/`** — Xcode project
- **`android/`** — Android Studio / Gradle project

Both load your **live Next.js deployment** in a WebView (`server.url`), so API routes and SQLite stay on the server — no static export of the whole app.

Run **`npm run cap:sync`** after changing Capacitor config, plugins, or `www/`.

### URL the app opens

Set one of these in **`.env.local`** (same as Next):

- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`** — e.g. `https://app.beponofitco.com` (used for Capacitor if set)
- or **`CAPACITOR_SERVER_URL`** — overrides for the native shell only (e.g. local dev)

Then run:

```bash
npm run cap:sync
```

`npx cap sync` reads `.env.local` via `dotenv` in `capacitor.config.ts` and writes native config under `ios/` and `android/` (some paths are gitignored — regenerate with `cap sync`).

**Local dev against your Mac:** use your LAN IP, e.g. `CAPACITOR_SERVER_URL=http://192.168.1.10:3000` and `npm run dev` with host `0.0.0.0` if needed; `cleartext` is enabled for `http:`.

### Universal Links & App Links (QR / https URLs → open native app)

Production serves:

- `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` — iOS Universal Links (`APPLE_TEAM_ID`, optional `IOS_BUNDLE_ID`; defaults match this repo / Xcode).
- `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` — Android verification (`ANDROID_SHA256_CERT_FINGERPRINTS`, comma-separated SHA-256 from Play App Signing or your upload key; optional `ANDROID_APP_LINK_PACKAGE`).

**Keep one hostname everywhere:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, the `applinks:` entry in `ios/App/App/App.entitlements`, and Android’s app-link host (default `app.beponofitco.com`; override with Gradle/env **`APP_LINK_HOST`**). If you change domains, update all three and ship new store builds.

On the Apple Developer portal, the App ID for `co.ponofit.app` must have the **Associated Domains** capability enabled (matches entitlements).

After changing native files, run **`npm run cap:sync`**, rebuild in Xcode / Android Studio, and test on a real device (simulators don’t fully exercise universal links).

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run cap:sync          # copy web assets + update native project
npm run cap:ios           # open Xcode
npm run cap:android       # open Android Studio
```

**iOS:** In Xcode: pick your team, set signing, choose a device or simulator, Run.

**Android:** In Android Studio: open the `android` folder, let Gradle sync, Run on an emulator or device (USB debugging). For Play Store you’ll use **Build → Generate Signed Bundle / APK** when ready.

---

## Push `native-shell` to GitHub (you’re on the branch)

```bash
git status
git add -A
git commit -m "Describe your native-shell change"
git push -u origin native-shell    # first time only; after that: git push
```

If `native-shell` already exists on the remote, use `git push` (no `-u` needed after the first push).

To confirm which branch you’re on: `git branch --show-current`

---

## App Store (Apple)

1. Apple Developer Program (you have this).
2. In Xcode: **Signing & Capabilities** → your team, unique bundle ID if you change from `co.ponofit.app`.
3. **Archive** → **Distribute App** → App Store Connect.

---

## Google Play (Android)

1. [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console) developer account.
2. Create an app listing; use **App bundle** (AAB) from Android Studio.
3. Signing: create or use an upload key in Android Studio (**Build → Generate Signed Bundle**).

---

## Next: Kisi Tap-to-Unlock

Requires **native** iOS/Android code (Kisi SDK) to read the reader beacon and send `proximity_proof` to your existing `/api/kisi/unlock` — not in the WebView.

---

## Git reference

**Switch to an existing branch** (no `-c`):

```bash
git switch native-shell
git switch main
```

**Create a branch** (only once):

```bash
git switch -c branch-name
```

If you see `fatal: a branch named 'native-shell' already exists`, use `git switch native-shell` instead.

**Push the app branch** (first time sets upstream):

```bash
git push -u origin native-shell
```

## Tag before big migrations

Optional but recommended: tag `main` before large native work (e.g. `pre-native-shell`) so you can always compare or branch from that point.

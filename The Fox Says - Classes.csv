5,Circuit Class (For Everyone),Bekah,1/14/2026,18:30:00,4,Open,25,,Classes,"This is the beginner version of our Circuit Class.  It meets once a week for four weeks and will get you more than ready for our Circuit Class.  The focus remains on strength and mobility, but you'll get the most in-depth instruction and will learn and grow with others who also need a little more help!"
